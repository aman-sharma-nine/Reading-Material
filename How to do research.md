**Dont Reinvent the wheel** 

Whatever the problem, chances are that someone, some- where, has worked on something similar. Maybe that person is in your organization and can answer all your questions in the course of a phone call. Maybe other people in your field, in another division or another company, have seen the same problem already find out who they are and get to know them. Do your research and ask questions; you will save yourself a lot of time and effort. Your time is valuable, so don’t waste it by reinventing the wheel!

Learn from others’ successes and mistakes. Leverage your valuable time and don’t reinvent the wheel!

Tips to make research more efficient and effective.

Tip #1

**Start with the annual report.**

 If you want to get up to speed on a company as quickly as possible, the first place to turn is the annual report. It’s easy to obtain (many companies now post their annuals on the World Wide Web) and contains a great deal of information beyond the financial data. 

When you get a company’s annual, turn first to the “Message to Shareholders” or “Chairman’s Remarks” at the front. If you read the section carefully, and a little skeptically, you’ll find out a lot about how the company has performed in the last year, where management hopes to take the company in the future, and the strategy for getting there. You’ll usually also get a quick break- down of key financial indicators such as stock price, revenue, and earnings per share. Go further into the annual, and you’ll find out about the company’s business units and product lines, who its senior managers are, and where the company has offices and pro- duction facilities. Then you can plough into the numbers.

Tip #2

**Look for outliers.** 

When you’ve collected a large amount of data on a particular aspect of your problem, look for outliers—
things that are especially good or bad. Use a computer to get a quick picture.

Tip #3

**Look for best practice.** 

There’s an old saying that no matter how good you are at something, there’s always somebody better.
This is as true in business as it is anywhere else. Find out what the best performers in the industry are doing and imitate them. Often, this is the quickest antidote to poor performance.



# **Conducting Interviews**/meetings



Tip #1

**Prepare an interview guide**

A guide is your best tool for getting what you want from interviewees and for making the best use of your time—and theirs. This is divided into two parts -

 	1. What are the questions that need answers?  Write then in order.
 	2. Define the purpose/expected outcome- what do you really need out of this interview? What are you trying to achieve? Why are you talking to this person?
 	3. When deciding on which questions to ask, you might want to include some to which you know the answer. This may sound counterintuitive, but it’s really very useful. On questions of fact, asking a “ringer” will give you some insights into the interviewee’s honesty and/or knowledge. For complex issues, you may think you “know” the answer, but there may be more than one; you should find out as many as possible.
 	4. Define ultimate objective - Once you've prepared the guide, ask youself "What are the three things I most want from this interview?"
 	5. Finally ask this standard questions-  When you’ve asked all your questions, or you’re running out of time, put away your guide and ask the interviewee if there’s anything else he’d like to tell you or any question you forgot to ask. As often as not, the interviewee will say no, but every once in a while you’ll strike paydirt. Remember that, chances are, the people you interview know their organizations, their business units, or their departments better than you do. They may know which problems are eluding senior managers, who’s pushing which agenda, or where the bones are buried. And sometimes, if you’re lucky, they’ll tell you.

Tip #2

**Listen**

When you’re picking people’s brains, ask questions and then let them do the talking. Most people like to talk, especially if you let them know you’re interested in what they’re saying. Keep the interview on track by breaking in when necessary.

The main thing to remember when trying to get information from other is that they need to feel you are listening and that you’re interested in what they have to say. Use positive body language and always take notes.

Ask open ended questions



Tip #3

**Lets interviewee's boss set up the meeting** - this will force interviewee to take it more seriously and not cancel at the last moment.



Tip #4

**Interview in pairs**- Take your Associate to take notes so you can focus on asking questions and notice verbal clues

Tip #5

**Paraphrase** - Repeat what interviewee has just said but with your understanding 

Tip #6

**Be sensitive to interviewee**

Tipe #7

**Dont ask too much** - If you compound that discomfort by pressing too hard, you may find that the interviewee becomes uncooperative or even hostile. You never know when you may want to come back to this person for more information, so don’t shut the door.

Tip #8 

**Be empathetic to interviewee** - Remember that, for many people, being interviewed about problems in their job or business can be unnerving. You have a responsibility to be sensitive to their fears. Allaying the fears of interviewees means demonstrating how the process benefits them—not just the interview, but the whole process of solving the organization’s problems.

Tip #9

**ALWAYS WRITE A THANK-YOU NOTE**
